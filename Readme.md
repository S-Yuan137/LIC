# some codes for Line integral Covolution Visualziation
Author: SB

## goals
1. 2d LIC 
   1. with colour maps
   2. with parallel acceleration
2. 3d LIC 
   1. with parallel computation
   2. advanced rendering techniques
   
## possible tools
parallel: taichi, TensorFlow, Numba, 
colour: Matplotlib
visualization: PyVista 

## current state (goals achieved)
a 3d LIC using NumPy without parallel

## current problems
1. Efficiency
